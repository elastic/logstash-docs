=== Command-line flags

Logstash has the following flags. You can use the `--help` flag to display this information.

*`-f, --config CONFIG_PATH`*::
  Load the Logstash config from a specific file
  or directory.  If a directory is given, all
  files in that directory will be concatenated
  in lexicographical order and then parsed as a
  single config file. You can also specify
  wildcards (globs) and any matched files will
  be loaded in the order described above.

*`-e CONFIG_STRING`*::
  Use the given string as the configuration
  data. Same syntax as the config file. If no
  input is specified, then the following is
  used as the default input:
  `input { stdin { type => stdin } }`
  and if no output is specified, then the
  following is used as the default output:
  `output { stdout { codec => rubydebug } }`.
  If you wish to use both defaults, please use
  the empty string for the `-e` flag.
  The default is "".

*`-w, --pipeline-workers COUNT`*::
  Sets the number of pipeline workers to run.
  The default is 8.
 
*`-b, --pipeline-batch-size SIZE`*::
  Size of batches the pipeline is to work in.
  The default is 125.
  This parameter defines the maximum number of
  events an individual worker thread will collect
  before attempting to execute its filters and
  outputs. Larger batch sizes are generally more
  efficient, but come at the cost of increased
  memory  overhead. You may have to increase the
  JVM heap size by setting the `LS_HEAP_SIZE`
  variable to effectively use the option.
   
*`-u, --pipeline-batch-delay DELAY_IN_MS`*::
  When creating pipeline event batches, how long
  to wait while polling for the next event.
  The default is 5ms.

*`-w, --filterworkers COUNT`*::
  DEPRECATED. Now an alias for `--pipeline-workers`
  and `-w`.

*`-l, --log FILE`*::
  Write Logstash internal logs to the given
  file. Without this flag, Logstash will emit
  logs to standard output.

*`-v`*::
  DEPRECATED. Increase verbosity of Logstash internal logs.
  Specifying once will show 'informational'
  logs. Specifying twice will show 'debug'
  logs. This flag is deprecated. You should use
  `--verbose` or `--debug` instead.

*`--quiet`*::
  Quieter Logstash logging. This causes only 
  errors to be emitted.
 
*`--verbose`*::
  More verbose logging. This causes 'info' 
  level logs to be emitted.

*`--debug`*::
  Most verbose logging. This causes 'debug'
  level logs to be emitted.

*`--debug-config`*::
  Print the compiled config ruby code out as
  a debug log (you must also have `--debug` enabled).
  WARNING: This will include any 'password' options
  passed to plugin configs as plaintext, and may result
  in plaintext passwords appearing in your logs!
  The default is false.

*`-V, --version`*::
  Emit the version of Logstash and its friends,
  then exit.

*`-p, --pluginpath PATH`*::
  A path of where to find plugins. This flag
  can be given multiple times to include
  multiple paths. Plugins are expected to be
  in a specific directory hierarchy:
  `PATH/logstash/TYPE/NAME.rb` where `TYPE` is
  `inputs`, `filters`, `outputs`, or `codecs`
  and `NAME` is the name of the plugin.

*`-t, --configtest`*::
  Check configuration for valid syntax and then exit. 
  Note that grok patterns are not checked for
  correctness with this flag. Logstash can read multiple
  config files from a directory. If you combine this
  flag with `--debug`, Logstash will log the combined
  config file, annotating the individual config blocks
  with the source file it came from.

*`--[no-]allow-unsafe-shutdown`*::
  Force Logstash to exit during shutdown even
  if there are still inflight events in memory.
  By default, Logstash will refuse to quit until all
  received events have been pushed to the outputs.
  The default is false.
  
*`-r, --[no-]auto-reload`*::
  Monitor configuration changes and reload
  whenever the configuration is changed.
  NOTE: Use SIGHUP to manually reload the config
  The default is false.

*`--reload-interval RELOAD_INTERVAL`*::
  How frequently to poll the configuration location
  for changes, in seconds.
  The default is 3 seconds.
  
*`--allow-env`*::
  experimental[] Enables templating of environment variable
  values. Instances of `${VAR}` in strings will be replaced
  with the respective environment variable value named "VAR".
  The default is false.
  
*`--[no-]log-in-json`*::
  Specify that Logstash should write its own logs in JSON form - one
  event per line. If false, Logstash will log using Ruby's
  Object#inspect (not easy to machine-parse).
  The default is false.

*`-h, --help`*::
  Print help
