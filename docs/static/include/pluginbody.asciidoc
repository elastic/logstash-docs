=== How to write a Logstash {plugintype} plugin

To develop a new {plugintype} for Logstash, you build a self-contained Ruby gem
whose source code lives in its own GitHub repository. The Ruby gem can then be
hosted and shared on RubyGems.org. You can use the example {plugintype}
implementation as a starting point. (If you're unfamiliar with
Ruby, you can find an excellent quickstart guide at
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/[].)

NOTE: As of Logstash 1.5, all plugins are self-contained Ruby gems. This change
makes it possible to develop and release plugins separately. In previous
versions, plugins were part of the core Logstash distribution.
