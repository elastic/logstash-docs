== Preface
Logstash is a tool for receiving, processing and outputting logs. All kinds of
logs. System logs, webserver logs, error logs, application logs, and just about
anything you can throw at it. Sounds great, eh?

Logstash provides a powerful pipeline for storing, querying, and analyzing your
logs. When using Elasticsearch as a backend data store and Kibana as a front-end
reporting tool, Logstash acts as the workhorse.  It includes an arsenal of
built-in inputs, filters, codecs, and outputs, enabling you to harness some
powerful functionality with a small amount of effort. So, let's get started!
