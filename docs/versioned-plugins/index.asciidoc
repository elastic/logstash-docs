Version overrides to manage versioning quirks between versioned plugins and stack/ecs.

On occasion, we'll need to make adjustments in a generated file to fix broken links.
In that case, add a version override setting to the plugin file (such as inputs/beats-v6.1.0.asciidoc).
Be sure to reset the in-file value back to the default value here to avoid spillover into
other files.
