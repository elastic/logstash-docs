These VPR settings correspond to the LSR settings in logstash/docs/include/attributes-ls.asciidoc
When we update one, we must update the other


Use caution when employing this approach, as there are versioning implications. 

The Versioned Plugin Reference isn't stack versioned. 
This detail could make consistent messaging across plugins and versions tricky. 
If we apply an attribute and then change the text, the new text will be applied to every version (past, present, and future) of every plugin using the attribute.

One possibility: introduce a new attribute for each major change to messaging, and replace the old attribute with the new one in the source file. Then the updated messaging will be applied only to applicable plugin versions and later.

Attribute text formatted without hard wrap is deliberate. 
Otherwise, text breaks at return and content after the return is dropped. 

Text is written to accommodate multiple versions because plugins are not stack versioned.

:ecs-default: When the `ecs_compatibility` option for this plugin is not explicitly set, its effective value depends on the `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` setting for the pipeline in `pipelines.yml`, or globally in {logstash-ref}/logstash-settings-file.html[`logstash.yml`], allowing you to specify your preferred behavior at the plugin, pipeline, or system level. If no preference is specified, the default value is `v8` for Logstash 8 or `disabled` for all earlier releases of Logstash. For more information about ECS compatibility settings in Logstash and plugins, see {logstash-ref}/ls-ecs[ECS in Logstash].
