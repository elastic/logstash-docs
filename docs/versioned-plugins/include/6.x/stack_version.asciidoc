Logstash plugins are versioned independently of Logstash, the Elastic Stack, and other plugins.
For the generated plugin docs in the Logstash Reference, stack versioning is handled automatically because the Logstash Reference understands stack versioning. 
The Versioned Plugin Reference is not stack versioned and has no concept of stack versioning.
This situation becomes an issue when we link from the Versioned Plugin Reference to stack or solution docs.
In the past, we've set `{branch}` to `current` as a workaround. 
This approach isn't ideal because it results in old versions of plugin docs linking to our latest documentation.
This mismatch between new features/options and old plugins can be confusing. 
In the 8.2 timeframe, we introduced tooling that looks at https://github.com/elastic/docs/tree/master/shared/versions/stack to approximate a version.
This file implements the approximated versioning in plugin doc source to populate variables in urls. 
Note that this content is set up to be conditional only for the Versiong Plugin Reference.
Why? Because the stack versioning in the Logstash Reference is precise while stack versioning in the Versioned Plugin Reference is only an approximation.
