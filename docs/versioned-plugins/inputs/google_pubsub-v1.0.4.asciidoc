Google deps
This is a https://github.com/elastic/logstash[Logstash] input plugin for 
https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/[Google Pub/Sub]. The plugin can subscribe 
to a topic and ingest messages.

The main motivation behind the development of this plugin was to ingest 
https://cloud.google.com/logging/[Stackdriver Logging] messages via the 
https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/using_exported_logs[Exported Logs] 
feature of Stackdriver Logging.

==== Prerequisites

You must first create a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the 
Google Pub/Sub API. If you intend to use the plugin ingest Stackdriver Logging 
messages, you must also enable the Stackdriver Logging API and configure log 
exporting to Pub/Sub. There is plentiful information on 
https://cloud.google.com/ to get started: 

- Google Cloud Platform Projects and https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/[Overview]
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/[documentation]
- Stackdriver Logging https://cloud.google.com/logging/[documentation]

==== Cloud Pub/Sub

Currently, this module requires you to create a `topic` manually and specify 
it in the logstash config file. You must also specify a `subscription`, but 
the plugin will attempt to create the pull-based `subscription` on its own. 

All messages received from Pub/Sub will be converted to a logstash `event` 
and added to the processing pipeline queue. All Pub/Sub messages will be 
`acknowledged` and removed from the Pub/Sub `topic` (please see more about 
https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/overview#concepts)[Pub/Sub concepts]. 

It is generally assumed that incoming messages will be in JSON and added to 
the logstash `event` as-is. However, if a plain text message is received, the 
plugin will return the raw text in as `raw_message` in the logstash `event`. 

==== Authentication

You have two options for authentication depending on where you run Logstash. 

1. If you are running Logstash outside of Google Cloud Platform, then you will 
need to create a Google Cloud Platform Service Account and specify the full 
path to the JSON private key file in your config. You must assign sufficient 
roles to the Service Account to create a subscription and to pull messages 
from the subscription. Learn more about GCP Service Accounts and IAM roles 
here:

  - Google Cloud Platform IAM https://cloud.google.com/iam/[overview]
  - Creating Service Accounts https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts[overview]
  - Granting Roles https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts[overview]

2. If you are running Logstash on a Google Compute Engine instance, you may opt 
to use Application Default Credentials. In this case, you will not need to 
specify a JSON private key file in your config.

==== Stackdriver Logging (optional)

If you intend to use the logstash plugin for Stackdriver Logging message 
ingestion, you must first manually set up the Export option to Cloud Pub/Sub and 
the manually create the `topic`. Please see the more detailed instructions at, 
https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/using_exported_logs [Exported Logs] 
and ensure that the https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export#manual-access-pubsub[necessary permissions] 
have also been manually configured.

Logging messages from Stackdriver Logging exported to Pub/Sub are received as 
JSON and converted to a logstash `event` as-is in 
https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/using_exported_logs#log_entries_in_google_pubsub_topics[this format].

==== Sample Configuration

Below is a copy of the included `example.conf-tmpl` file that shows a basic 
configuration for this plugin.

[source,ruby]
----------------------------------
input {
    google_pubsub {
        # Your GCP project id (name)
        project_id => "my-project-1234"

        # The topic name below is currently hard-coded in the plugin. You
        # must first create this topic by hand and ensure you are exporting
        # logging to this pubsub topic.
        topic => "logstash-input-dev"

        # The subscription name is customizeable. The plugin will attempt to
        # create the subscription (but use the hard-coded topic name above).
        subscription => "logstash-sub"

        # If you are running logstash within GCE, it will use
        # Application Default Credentials and use GCE's metadata
        # service to fetch tokens.  However, if you are running logstash
        # outside of GCE, you will need to specify the service account's
        # JSON key file below.
        #json_key_file => "/home/erjohnso/pkey.json"
    }
}
output { stdout { codec => rubydebug } }

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-json_key_file>> |a valid filesystem path|No
| <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-max_messages>> |{logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#number[number]|Yes
| <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-project_id>> |{logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]|Yes
| <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-subscription>> |{logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]|Yes
| <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-topic>> |{logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]|Yes
|=======================================================================

Also see <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for a list of options supported by all
input plugins.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-json_key_file"]
===== `json_key_file` 

  * Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#path[path]
  * There is no default value for this setting.

If logstash is running within Google Compute Engine, the plugin will use
GCE's Application Default Credentials. Outside of GCE, you will need to
specify a Service Account JSON key file.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-max_messages"]
===== `max_messages` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#number[number]
  * Default value is `5`



[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-project_id"]
===== `project_id` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Google Cloud Project ID (name, not number)

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-subscription"]
===== `subscription` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]

Google Cloud Pub/Sub Topic and Subscription.
Note that the topic must be created manually with Cloud Logging
pre-configured export to PubSub configured to use the defined topic.
The subscription will be created automatically by the plugin.
