.Technical Preview
****
This {esf-name} input plugin is part of a _Technical Preview_, which means that both configuration options and implementation details are subject to change in minor releases without being preceded by deprecation warnings.

Before upgrading this plugin or Logstash itself, please pay special attention to this plugin's https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-elastic_serverless_forwarder/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md[CHANGELOG.md] to avoid being caught by surprise.
****


[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-enrichment"]
==== Enrichment

This input provides _minimal enrichment_ on events, and avoids including information about itself, the client from which it received the data, or about the original event as-decoded from the request.

NOTE: Senders are advised to use care with respect to fields that are {logstash-ref}/processing.html#reserved-fields[reserved in Logstash].
      ESF sends the Logstash-required `@timestamp` field by default, but if this value is missing it will be populated with the current time.

// BEGIN: Elastic-internal implementation details

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-blocking"]
==== Blocking Behavior

When the Logstash pipeline that is receiving events from this input has a full queue, it prevents the pipeline's inputs from putting additional events into the queue until the capacity to do so becomes available.
This may result in an HTTP request timing out with some or all of its events unprocessed.
A client that receives an HTTP request timeout is expected to retry the entire request, even though it may cause duplication of data.

When this plugin is blocked, it will reject _new_ requests with HTTP `429 Too Many Requests`.
Clients that receive `429`-s are expected to wait a moment before retrying the request â€” exponential back-off is encouraged to ease flood recovery.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-security"]
==== Security

This plugin has SSL on-by-default.

At a minimum, you will need to either configure the plugin to present its identity, or disable SSL.

Additionally, you may wish to authenticate clients using SSL client authentication, and/or authenticate requests using HTTP Basic authentication as described below.

===== SSL Identity

In order to establish SSL with a client, this input plugin will need to present an SSL certificate that the client trusts, and have access to the associated key.
These are configurable with <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate>>, <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key>>, and optionally <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key_passphrase>>.

===== SSL Client Authentication

By default, this plugin does not request certificates from clients during SSL negotiation.

It can be configured to either request or require client certificates using <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_client_authentication>>,
which often also requires configuring it with a list of <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate_authorities>> to trust.
When validating a certificate that is presented, <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode>> controls how certificates are verified.

NOTE: ESF does not currently support _presenting_ client certificates, so requesting or requiring clients to present identity is only useful when combined with an SSL-terminating proxy.

===== SSL Advanced Configuration

This plugin exposes several advanced SSL configurations:

* <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_cipher_suites>>
* <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_supported_protocols>>
* <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_handshake_timeout>>

===== HTTP Basic Authentication

You can configure this plugin to authenticate requests using HTTP Basic authentication by configuring <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_username>> and <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_password>>.

NOTE: Basic Authentication is not a substitute for SSL, as it provides neither secrecy nor security on its own.
      When used with SSL disabled, HTTP Basic credentials are transmitted in effectively clear-text and can be easily recovered by an adversary.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-es-output-notes"]
==== Using {esf-name} with the Elasticsearch output
Here are some tips for configuring the {esf} input to work with the elasticsearch output:

* Set the `document_id` in the output configuration when you use the {esf}  input with an {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#plugins-outputs-elasticsearch[Elasticsearch output plugin].
+
[source,ruby]
----
output {
  elasticsearch {
      ...
      document_id => "%{[@metadata][_id]}"
      ...
  }
}
----
* Starting from version 1.10.0 of {esf-name}, configuring `document_id` as shown in the example above is sufficient (the `_id` field is no longer available, and instead, Logstash now receives the `@metadata._id` field).

* For {esf-name} v1.9.0 and earlier, rename the field `_id` to `@metadata._id` with a filter:
+
[source,ruby]
----
filter {
    # support ESF < 1.10
    if [_id] and ![@metadata][_id] {
      mutate { rename => { "_id" => "[@metadata][_id]" } }
    }
}

input plugins.

&nbsp;

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_password"]
===== `auth_basic_password`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#password[password]
* There is no default value for this setting.

Password for HTTP basic authorization.
Requires <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_username>>.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_username"]
===== `auth_basic_username`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]
* There is no default value for this setting.

Username for basic authorization.
Requires <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_password>>.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-host"]
===== `host`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]
* Default value is `"0.0.0.0"` (all available interfaces)

The host or ip to bind

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-port"]
===== `port`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#number[number]
* Default value is `8080`

The TCP port to bind to

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl"]
===== `ssl`
deprecated[0.1.3, Replaced by <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled>>]

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#boolean[boolean]
* Default value is `true`

Events are by default sent over SSL, which requires configuring this plugin to present an identity certificate using <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate>> and key using <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key>>.

You can disable SSL with `+ssl => false+`.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate"]
===== `ssl_certificate`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#path[path]
* There is no default value for this setting.

SSL certificate to use.
This certificate _MUST_ be PEM-formatted, and _MAY_ contain a chain of certificates starting with the certificate that identifies itself, followed by zero or more ordered intermediates optionally ending with the root signing authority.
Providing a complete chain allows clients to trust our certificate if their configuration allows them to trust one of our intermediates.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate_authorities"]
===== `ssl_certificate_authorities`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#array[array]
* Default value is `[]`

Validate client certificates against these authorities.
You can define multiple files or paths. All the certificates will
be read and added to the trust store.

If you wish to perform client authentication, you need to set `ssl_client_authentication` to `optional` or `required`.


[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_cipher_suites"]
===== `ssl_cipher_suites`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#array[array]
* Default value is `['TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384', 'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256', 'TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256', 'TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384', 'TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384', 'TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256', 'TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256', 'TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256', 'TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256', 'TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384', 'TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384', 'TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256', 'TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256']`

The list of cipher suites to use, listed by priorities.

This is an advanced SSL configuration.

This default list applies for OpenJDK 11.0.14 and higher.
For older JDK versions, the default list includes only suites supported by that version.
For example, the ChaCha20 family of ciphers is not supported in older versions.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_client_authentication"]
===== `ssl_client_authentication`

* Value can be any of:
** `none`: do not request client's certificate, or validate certificates that are presented
** `optional`: request client's certificate, and validate it against our trust authorities _if-and-only-if_ it is presented
** `required`: require a valid certificate from the client that is signed by a trusted certificate authority
* Default value is `"none"`

By default the server doesn't do any client authentication.
This means that connections from clients are _private_ when SSL is enabled, but that this input will allow SSL connections from _any_ client.
If you wish to configure this plugin to reject connections from untrusted hosts, you will need to configure this plugin to authenticate clients, and may also need to configure it with a list of `ssl_certificate_authorities`.


[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled"]
===== `ssl_enabled`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#boolean[boolean]
* Default value is `true`

Events are, by default, sent over SSL, which requires configuring this plugin to present an identity certificate using <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate>> and key using <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key>>.

You can disable SSL with `+ssl_enabled => false+`.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_handshake_timeout"]
===== `ssl_handshake_timeout`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#number[number]
* Default value is `10000`

Time in milliseconds for an incomplete ssl handshake to timeout

This is an advanced SSL configuration.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key"]
===== `ssl_key`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#path[path]
* There is no default value for this setting.

SSL key to use.

NOTE: This key need to be in the PKCS8 format, you can convert it with https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-pkcs8.html[OpenSSL]
for more information.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key_passphrase"]
===== `ssl_key_passphrase`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#password[password]
* There is no default value for this setting.

SSL key passphrase to use.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_supported_protocols"]
===== `ssl_supported_protocols`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#array[array]
* Allowed values are: `'TLSv1.1'`, `'TLSv1.2'`, `'TLSv1.3'`
* Default depends on the JDK being used. With up-to-date Logstash, the default is `['TLSv1.2', 'TLSv1.3']`.
`'TLSv1.1'` is not considered secure and is only provided for legacy applications.

List of allowed SSL/TLS versions to use when establishing a connection to the HTTP endpoint.

This is an advanced SSL configuration.

For Java 8 `'TLSv1.3'` is supported  only since **8u262** (AdoptOpenJDK), but requires that you set the
`LS_JAVA_OPTS="-Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.3"` system property in Logstash.

NOTE: If you configure the plugin to use `'TLSv1.1'` on any recent JVM, such as the one packaged with Logstash,
the protocol is disabled by default and needs to be enabled manually by changing `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` in
the *$JDK_HOME/conf/security/java.security* configuration file. That is, `TLSv1.1` needs to be removed from the list.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode"]
===== `ssl_verification_mode`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]
* There is only one currently-supported mode:
** `certificate`: verifies that a certificate provided by the client is signed by a trusted authority (CA), is within its valid date range, and that the client has possession of the associated key, but does _not_ perform hostname validation.
// NOTE: `ssl_verification_mode => full` is pending upstream support, but when it arrives it will look like:
////
** `full`: fully validates the certificate as in `certificate` mode, and also validates that the client's outbound IP address is represented in the certificate's identity claims for `subject` and/or `subjectAltName`.
////
* The default value is `certificate`.

When <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_client_authentication>> causes a client to present a certificate, this setting controls how that certificate is verified.

NOTE: Client identity is not typically validated using SSL because the receiving server only has access to the client's outbound-ip, which is not always constant and is frequently not represented in the certificate's subject or subjectAltNames extensions.
      For more information, see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2818#section-3.1[RFC2818 Â§ 3.2 (HTTP over TLS -- Client Identity)]
