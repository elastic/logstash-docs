=== Azure Event Hubs plugin {version}

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

This plugin consumes events from
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs[Azure Event Hubs], a
highly scalable data streaming platform and event ingestion service. Event
producers send events to the Azure Event Hub, and this plugin consumes those
events for use with Logstash.

Many Azure services integrate with the Azure Event Hubs.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-azure-monitor[Azure
Monitor], for example, integrates with Azure Event Hubs to provide infrastructure metrics.

===== Event Hub connection string

The plugin uses the connection string to access Azure Events Hubs. Find the
connection string here: https://portal.azure.com[Azure Portal]`-> Event Hub ->
Shared access polices`. The event_hub_connections option passes the Event Hub
connection strings for the basic configuration.

Sample connection string:

[source,text]
----
Endpoint=sb://logstash.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=activity-log-read-only;SharedAccessKey=mm6AbDcEfj8lk7sjsbzoTJ10qAkiSaG663YykEAG2eg=;EntityPath=insights-operational-logs
----

===== Blob Storage and connection string

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs[Azure Blob Storage
account] is an essential part of Azure-to-Logstash configuration.
A Blob Storage account is a central location that enables multiple instances of
Logstash to work together to process events. It records the
offset (location) of processed events. On restart, Logstash resumes processing
exactly where it left off.

Configuration notes:

*  A Blob Storage account is highly recommended for use with this plugin, and is
likely required for production servers.
* The `storage_connection` option passes the blob storage connection string.
* Configure all Logstash instances to use the same `storage_connection` to get the
benefits of shared processing.

Sample Blob Storage connection string:

[source,text]
----
DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=logstash;AccountKey=ETOPnkd/hDAWidkEpPZDiXffQPku/SZdXhPSLnfqdRTalssdEuPkZwIcouzXjCLb/xPZjzhmHfwRCGo0SBSw==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net
----

Find the connection string to Blob Storage here:
https://portal.azure.com[Azure Portal]`-> Blob Storage account -> Access keys`.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-best-practices"]
===== Best practices

Here are some guidelines to help you avoid data conflicts that can cause lost
events.

* **Create a Logstash consumer group.**
Create a new consumer group specifically for Logstash. Do not use the $default or
any other consumer group that might already be in use. Reusing consumer groups
among non-related consumers can cause unexpected behavior and possibly lost
events. All Logstash instances should use the same consumer group so that they can
work together for processing events.
* **Avoid overwriting offset with multiple Event Hubs.**
The offsets (position) of the Event Hubs are stored in the configured Azure Blob
store. The Azure Blob store uses paths like a file system to store the offsets.
If the paths between multiple Event Hubs overlap, then the offsets may be stored
incorrectly.
To avoid duplicate file paths, use the advanced configuration model and make
sure that at least one of these options is different per Event Hub:
** storage_connection
** storage_container (defaults to Event Hub name if not defined)
** consumer_group
* **Set number of threads correctly.**
The number of threads should equal the number of Event Hubs plus one (or more).
Each Event Hub needs at least one thread. An additional thread is needed to help
coordinate the other threads. The number of threads should not exceed the number
of Event Hubs multiplied by the number of partitions per Event Hub plus one.
Threads are currently available only as a global setting.  If you are using multiple
pipelines, the threads setting applies to each pipeline independently.
** Sample scenario: Event Hubs = 4. Partitions on each Event Hub = 3.
Minimum threads is 5 (4 Event Hubs plus one). Maximum threads is 13 (4 Event
Hubs times 3 partitions plus one).
** If you’re collecting activity logs from one event hub instance,
then only 2 threads (1 Event Hub plus one) are required.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-eh_config_models"]
==== Configuration models

This plugin supports two configuration models: basic and advanced. Basic
configuration is recommended for most use cases, and is illustrated in the
examples throughout this topic.

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-eh_basic_config"]
===== Basic configuration (default)

Basic configuration is the default and supports consuming from multiple Event
Hubs. All Events Hubs, except for the connection string, share the same
configuration.

You supply a list of Event Hub connection strings, complete with the Event Hub
EntityPath that defines the Event Hub name. All other configuration settings are
shared.

[source,ruby]
----
input {
   azure_event_hubs {
      event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...EntityPath=insights-logs-errors", "Endpoint=sb://example2...EntityPath=insights-metrics-pt1m"]
      threads => 8
      decorate_events => true
      consumer_group => "logstash"
      storage_connection => "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=example...."
   }
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-eh_advanced_config"]
===== Advanced configuration
The advanced configuration model accommodates deployments where different Event
Hubs require different configurations. Options can be configured per Event Hub.
You provide a list of Event Hub names through the `event_hubs` option. Under
each name, specify the configuration for that Event Hub. Options can be defined
globally or expressed per Event Hub.

If the same configuration option appears in both the global and `event_hub`
sections, the more specific (event_hub) setting takes precedence.

NOTE: Advanced configuration is not necessary or recommended for most use cases.

[source,ruby]
----
input {
   azure_event_hubs {
     config_mode => "advanced"
     threads => 8
     decorate_events => true
     storage_connection => "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=example...."
     event_hubs => [
        {"insights-operational-logs" => {
         event_hub_connection => "Endpoint=sb://example1..."
         initial_position => "beginning"
         consumer_group => "iam_team"
        }},
      {"insights-metrics-pt1m" => {
         event_hub_connection => "Endpoint=sb://example2..."
         initial_position => "end"
         consumer_group => "db_team"
       }}
     ]
   }
}
----

In this example, `storage_connection` and `decorate_events` are applied globally.
The two Event Hubs each have their own  settings for `consumer_groups`
and `initial_position`.

Also see <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for a list of options supported by all
input plugins.

NOTE: All Event Hubs options are common to both basic and advanced
configurations, with the following exceptions. The basic configuration uses
`event_hub_connections` to support multiple connections. The advanced
configuration uses `event_hubs` and `event_hub_connection` (singular).

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-config_mode"]
===== `config_mode`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]
* Valid entries are `basic` or `advanced`
* Default value is `basic`

Sets configuration to either <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-eh_basic_config>> or <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-eh_advanced_config>>.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"  , "Endpoint=sb://example2...;EntityPath=event_hub_name2"  ]
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_hubs"]
===== `event_hubs`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#array[array]
* No default value
* Ignored for basic configuration
* Required for advanced configuration

Defines the Event Hubs to be read. An array of hashes where each entry is a
hash of the Event Hub name and its configuration options.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
  config_mode => "advanced"
  event_hubs => [
      { "event_hub_name1" => {
          event_hub_connection => "Endpoint=sb://example1..."
      }},
      { "event_hub_name2" => {
          event_hub_connection => "Endpoint=sb://example2..."
          storage_connection => "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=example...."
          storage_container => "my_container"
     }}
   ]
   consumer_group => "logstash" # shared across all Event Hubs
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_hub_connections"]
===== `event_hub_connections`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#array[array]
* No default value
* Required for basic configuration

List of connection strings that identifies the Event Hubs to be read. Connection
strings include the EntityPath for the Event Hub.

The `event_hub_connections` option is defined
per Event Hub. All other configuration options are shared among Event Hubs.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"  , "Endpoint=sb://example2...;EntityPath=event_hub_name2"  ]
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-event_hub_connection"]
===== `event_hub_connection`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]
* No default value
* Valid only for advanced configuration

Connection string that identifies the Event Hub to be read. Advanced
configuration options can be set per Event Hub. This option modifies
`event_hub_name`, and should be nested under it. (See sample.) This option
accepts only one connection string.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   config_mode => "advanced"
   event_hubs => [
     { "event_hub_name1" => {
        event_hub_connection => "Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"
     }}
   ]
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-checkpoint_interval"]
===== `checkpoint_interval`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#number[number]
* Default value is `5` seconds
* Set to `0` to disable.

Interval in seconds to write checkpoints during batch processing. Checkpoints
tell Logstash where to resume processing after a restart. Checkpoints are
automatically written at the end of each batch, regardless of this setting.

Writing checkpoints too frequently can slow down processing unnecessarily.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"]
   checkpoint_interval => 5
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-consumer_group"]
===== `consumer_group`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]
* Default value is `$Default`

Consumer group used to read the Event Hub(s). Create a consumer group
specifically for Logstash. Then ensure that all instances of Logstash use that
consumer group so that they can work together properly.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"]
   consumer_group => "logstash"
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-decorate_events"]
===== `decorate_events`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#boolean[boolean]
* Default value is `false`

Adds metadata about the Event Hub, including Event Hub name, consumer_group,
processor_host, partition, offset, sequence, timestamp, and event_size.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"]
   decorate_events => true
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-initial_position"]
===== `initial_position`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]
* Valid arguments are `beginning`, `end`, `look_back`
* Default value is `beginning`

When first reading from an Event Hub, start from this position:

* `beginning` reads all pre-existing events in the Event Hub
* `end` does not read any pre-existing events in the Event Hub
* `look_back` reads `end` minus a number of seconds worth of pre-existing events.
You control the number of seconds using the `initial_position_look_back` option.

Note: If `storage_connection` is set, the `initial_position` value is used only
the first time Logstash reads from the Event Hub.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"]
   initial_position => "beginning"
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-initial_position_look_back"]
===== `initial_position_look_back`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#number[number]
* Default value is `86400`
* Used only if `initial_position` is set to `look-back`

Number of seconds to look back to find the initial position for pre-existing
events. This option is used only if `initial_position` is set to `look_back`. If
`storage_connection` is set, this configuration applies only the first time Logstash
reads from the Event Hub.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"]
   initial_position => "look_back"
   initial_position_look_back => 86400
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-max_batch_size"]
===== `max_batch_size`

* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#number[number]
* Default value is `125`

Maximum number of events retrieved and processed together. A checkpoint is
created after each batch. Increasing this value may help with performance, but
requires more memory.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"]
   max_batch_size => 125
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-storage_connection"]
===== `storage_connection`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]
* No default value

Connection string for blob account storage. Blob account storage persists the
offsets between restarts, and ensures that multiple instances of Logstash
process different partitions.
When this value is set, restarts resume where processing left off.
When this value is not set, the `initial_position` value is used on every restart.

We strongly recommend that you define this value for production environments.


[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"]
   storage_connection => "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=example...."
}
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-storage_container"]
===== `storage_container`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#string[string]
* Defaults to the Event Hub name if not defined

Name of the storage container used to persist offsets and allow multiple instances of Logstash
to work together.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   event_hub_connections => ["Endpoint=sb://example1...;EntityPath=event_hub_name1"]
   storage_connection => "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=example...."
   storage_container => "my_container"
}
----

To avoid overwriting offsets, you can use different storage containers. This is
particularly important if you are monitoring two Event Hubs with the same name.
You can use the advanced configuration model to configure different storage
containers.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
     config_mode => "advanced"
     consumer_group => "logstash"
     storage_connection => "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=example...."
     event_hubs => [
        {"insights-operational-logs" => {
         event_hub_connection => "Endpoint=sb://example1..."
         storage_container => "insights-operational-logs-1"
        }},
        {"insights-operational-logs" => {
         event_hub_connection => "Endpoint=sb://example2..."
         storage_container => "insights-operational-logs-2"
        }}
     ]
   }
----

[id="{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-threads"]
===== `threads`
* Value type is {logstash-ref}/configuration-file-structure.html#number[number]
* Minimum value is `2`
* Default value is `4`

Total number of threads used to process events. The value you set here applies
to all Event Hubs. Even with advanced configuration, this value is a global
setting, and can't be set per event hub.

[source,ruby]
----
azure_event_hubs {
   threads => 4
}
----

The number of threads should be the number of Event Hubs plus one or more.
See <<{version}-plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-best-practices>> for more information.
