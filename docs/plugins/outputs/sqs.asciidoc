=== Sqs output plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

Push events to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue.

SQS is a simple, scalable queue system that is part of the Amazon Web
Services suite of tools. Although SQS is similar to other queuing systems
such as Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), it uses a custom API and
requires that you have an AWS account. See http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/ for
more details on how SQS works, what the pricing schedule looks like and how
to setup a queue.

The "consumer" identity must have the following permissions on the queue:

  * `sqs:GetQueueUrl`
  * `sqs:SendMessage`
  * `sqs:SendMessageBatch`

Typically, you should setup an IAM policy, create a user and apply the IAM
policy to the user. See http://aws.amazon.com/iam/ for more details on
setting up AWS identities. A sample policy is as follows:

[source,json]
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
        "sqs:SendMessage",
        "sqs:SendMessageBatch"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sqs-queue"
    }
  ]
}

==== Batch Publishing
This output publishes messages to SQS in batches in order to optimize event
throughput and increase performance. This is done using the
[`SendMessageBatch`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessageBatch.html)
API. When publishing messages to SQS in batches, the following service limits
must be respected (see
[Limits in Amazon SQS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/limits-messages.html)):

  * The maximum allowed individual message size is 256KiB.
  * The maximum total payload size (i.e. the sum of the sizes of all
    individual messages within a batch) is also 256KiB.

This plugin will dynamically adjust the size of the batch published to SQS in
order to ensure that the total payload size does not exceed 256KiB.

WARNING: This output cannot currently handle messages larger than 256KiB. Any
single message exceeding this size will be dropped.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-access_key_id"]
===== `access_key_id` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

This plugin uses the AWS SDK and supports several ways to get credentials, which will be tried in this order:

1. Static configuration, using `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` params in logstash plugin config
2. External credentials file specified by `aws_credentials_file`
3. Environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
4. Environment variables `AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
5. IAM Instance Profile (available when running inside EC2)

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-aws_credentials_file"]
===== `aws_credentials_file` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Path to YAML file containing a hash of AWS credentials.
This file will only be loaded if `access_key_id` and
`secret_access_key` aren't set. The contents of the
file should look like this:

[source,ruby]
----------------------------------
    :access_key_id: "12345"
    :secret_access_key: "54321"
----------------------------------


[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-batch"]
===== `batch`  (DEPRECATED)

  * DEPRECATED WARNING: This configuration item is deprecated and may not be available in future versions.
  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `true`

Set to `true` to send messages to SQS in batches (with the
`SendMessageBatch` API) or `false` to send messages to SQS individually
(with the `SendMessage` API). The size of the batch is configurable via
`batch_events`.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-batch_events"]
