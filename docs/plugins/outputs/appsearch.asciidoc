=== App Search output plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

This output lets you send events to Elastic's App Search solution.
On receiving a batch of events from the Logstash pipeline, the plugin
will convert the events into documents and use App Search's bulk API
to index multiple events in one request.

Because App Search doesn't allow fields to being with `@timestamp`,
by default the fields `@timestamp` and `@version` will be removed from
each event prior to being sent to App Search. If you want to keep
the `@timestamp` field you can use the
<<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-timestamp_destination,timestamp_destination>> option
to store this timestamp in a different field.

This gem does not support codec customization.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-api_key"]
===== `api_key`

  * Value type is <<password,password>>
  * There is no default value

The private API Key with write permissions. Visit the https://app.swiftype.com/as/credentials[Credentials] in the App Search dashboard to find the key associated with your account.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-document_id"]
===== `document_id`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value

What to use as id for app search documents. This can be an interpolated value
like `myapp-%{sequence_id}`. Reusing ids will cause documents to be rewritten.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-engine"]
===== `engine`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value

The Engine name. Engine is your search engine created in App Search, an information repository that includes the indexed document records.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-host"]
===== `host`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value

The hostname of the App Search API that is associated with your App Search account.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-timestamp_destination"]
===== `timestamp_destination`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value

Where to move the timestamp value that all Logstash events contain in the `@timestamp` field. Since App Search doesn't support fields starting with `@timestamp`, by default this field will be deleted. If you wish to keep it, set this value to the name of the field where `@timestamp` will be copied to.
