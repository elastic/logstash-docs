=== Logstash output plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header-integration.asciidoc[]

==== Description

Send events to a {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-logstash.html[Logstash input plugin] in a pipeline that may be in another process or on another host.
You must have a TCP route to the port (defaults to 9800) on an interface that the downstream input is bound to.

NOTE: Sending events to _any_ destination other than a `logstash-input` plugin is neither advised nor supported.
      We will maintain cross-compatibility with any two supported versions of output/input pair and reserve the right to change details such as protocol and encoding.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-config-connecting"]
===== Configuration Concepts

Configure this output plugin to connect to a {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-logstash.html[Logstash input plugin] by specifying its `hosts`.
Depending on the downstream plugin's configuration, you may need to also configure the target port, SSL, and/or credentials.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-config-ssl-trust"]
===== Security: SSL Trust

When communicating over SSL, this plugin establishes trust of the server it connects to before transmitting credentials or events.

It does so by ensuring that the responding server presents a currently-valid certificate with identity claims matching host it is connecting to, signed by a trusted signing authority, along with proof-of-possession of the associated private key material.

The system trust store is used by default.
You can provide an _alternate_ source of trust with _ONE OF_:

* A PEM-formatted list of trusted certificate authorities (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate_authorities>>)
* A PKCS12- or JKS-formatted truststore (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path>>)

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-config-ssl-identity"]
===== Security: SSL Identity

If the downstream input plugin is configured to request or require client authentication, you can configure this plugin to provide its proof-of-identity with _ONE OF_:

* JKS- or PKCS12-formatted Keystore (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_keystore_path>>)
* PKCS8-formatted Certificate/Key pair (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate>>)

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-config-credentials"]
===== Security: Credentials

If the downstream `logstash-input` plugin is configured to require `username` and `password`,
you will need to configure this output with a matching <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-username>> and <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-password>>.

NOTE: when SSL is disabled, data and credentials will be transmitted in clear-text.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-options"]
==== Logstash Output Configuration Options

This plugin supports the following configuration options plus the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> described later.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-hosts"]
===== `hosts`

* Value type is list of <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Constraints:
** When using IPv6, IP address must be in an enclosed in brackets.
** When a port is not provided, the default `9800` is used.

The addresses of one or more downstream `input`s to connect to.

Host can be any of IPv4, IPv6 (in enclosed bracket) or host name, examples:

* `"127.0.0.1"`
* `"127.0.0.1:9801"`
* `"ds.example.com"`
* `"ds.example.com:9802"`
* `"[::1]"`
* `"[::1]:9803"`
* `"[2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]"`
* `"[2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]:9804"`

Plugin balances incoming load among the `hosts`. For more information, visit {logstash-ref}/plugins-integrations-logstash.html[Logstash integration plugin] _Load Balancing_ section.

When connecting, communication to downstream input {ls} is secured with SSL unless configured otherwise.

[WARNING]
.Disabling SSL is dangerous
============
The security of this plugin relies on SSL to avoid leaking credentials and to avoid running illegitimate ingest pipeline definitions.
============

NOTE: when using SSL, the server that responds must present a certificated with identity claim matching this host name or ip address.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-password"]
===== `password`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Required when <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-username>> is configured.

Password for password-based authentication.

When the downstream input plugin is configured with a `username` and `password`, you must also configure upstream outputs with a matching `username`/`password` pair.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled"]
===== `ssl_enabled`

* Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
* Default value is `true`

Logstash-to-Logstash communication is secured by default.
When the downstream input plugin disables SSL, it must also be disabled here.

You can disable SSL with `+ssl_enabled => false+`. When disabled, setting any `ssl_*` configuration causes configuration failure.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate"]
===== `ssl_certificate`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key>> is also required.
* Cannot be combined with configurations that disable SSL.

Path to a PEM-encoded certificate or certificate chain with which to identify this plugin to connecting downstream input.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate_authorities"]
===== `ssl_certificate_authorities`

* Value type is a <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Cannot be combined with configurations that disable SSL.
* Cannot be combined with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode, `+ssl_verification_mode => none+`>>.

One or more PEM-encoded files defining certificate authorities for use in downstream input authentication.
This setting can be used to _override_ the system trust store for verifying the SSL certificate presented by downstream input.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key"]
===== `ssl_key`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Required when connection identity is configured with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate>>
* Cannot be combined with configurations that disable SSL.

A path to an PEM-encoded _unencrypted_ PKCS8 SSL certificate key.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_keystore_path"]
===== `ssl_keystore_path`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_keystore_password>> is also required.
* Cannot be combined with configurations that disable SSL.

A path to a JKS- or PKCS12-formatted keystore with which to identify this plugin to the downstream input.
The provided identity will be used if the downstream input enables <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-config-ssl-trust,SSL client authentication>>.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_keystore_password"]
===== `ssl_keystore_password`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Required when connection identity is configured with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_keystore_path>>

* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path>> is also required.
* Cannot be combined with configurations that disable SSL.
* Cannot be combined with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode, `+ssl_verification_mode => none+`>>.

A path to a JKS- or PKCS12-formatted truststore with which to validate the identity claims of the downstream input.
The provided identity will be used if the downstream input enables <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-config-ssl-trust,SSL client authentication>>.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_password"]
===== `ssl_truststore_password`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Required when connection identity is configured with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path>>
* Cannot be combined with configurations that disable SSL.

Password for the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path>>

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode"]
===== `ssl_verification_mode`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* The supported modes are:
** `full`: verifies that a certificate provided by the client has an identity claim matching <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-hosts>>, is signed by a trusted authority (CA), is within its valid date range, and that the client has possession of the associated key.
** `none`: performs no validation of the presented certificate

* The default value is `full`.
* Cannot be combined with configurations that disable SSL.

When communicating over SSL, this setting controls how the downstream input's certificate is verified.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-username"]
===== `username`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-password>> is also required.
