=== Elastic Workplace Search output plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header-integration.asciidoc[]

==== Description

This output lets you send events to the https://www.elastic.co/workplace-search[Elastic Workplace Search] solution.
On receiving a batch of events from the Logstash pipeline, the plugin
converts the events into documents and uses the Workplace Search bulk API
to index multiple events in one request.

Workplace Search doesn't allow fields to begin with `@timestamp`.
By default the `@timestamp` and `@version` fields will be removed from
each event before the event is sent to Workplace Search. If you want to keep
the `@timestamp` field, you can use the
<<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-timestamp_destination,timestamp_destination>> option
to store the timestamp in a different field.

NOTE: This gem does not support codec customization.

==== Workplace Search Output Configuration Options

This plugin supports the following configuration options plus the
<<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> described later.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-access_token>> |<<password,password>>|Yes
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-document_id>> |<<string,string>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-source>> |<<string,string>>|Yes
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-timestamp_destination>> |<<string,string>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-url>> |<<string,string>>|Yes
|=======================================================================

Also see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for a list of options supported by all
output plugins.

&nbsp;

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-access_token"]
===== `access_token`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value

The source access token. Visit the source overview page in the Workplace Search dashboard to find the token associated with your source.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-document_id"]
===== `document_id`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value

The id for workplace search documents. This can be an interpolated value
like `myapp-%{sequence_id}`. Reusing ids will cause documents to be rewritten.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-source"]
===== `source`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value

The ID of the source you created in Workplace Search.
The `source` field supports
{logstash-ref}/event-dependent-configuration.html#sprintf[sprintf format] to
allow the source ID to be derived from a field value from each event, for
example `%{source_id}`.

Invalid source IDs cause ingestion to stop until the field value can be resolved into a valid source ID.
This situation can happen if the interpolated field value resolves to a value without a matching source,
or, if the field is missing from the event and cannot be resolved at all.

TIP: Consider adding a "default" source type in the configuration to catch errors if
the field is missing from the event.

Example:



[source,ruby]
----------------------------------
input {
  stdin {
    codec => json
  }
}

filter {
  if ![source_id] {
    mutate {
      add_field => {"source_id" => "default"}
    }
  }
}

output {
  elastic_workplace_search {
    source => "%{[source_id]}"
  }
}
----------------------------------

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-timestamp_destination"]
===== `timestamp_destination`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value

Where to move the value from the `@timestamp` field.

All Logstash events contain a `@timestamp` field.
Workplace Search doesn't support fields starting with `@timestamp`, and
by default, the `@timestamp` field will be deleted.

To keep the timestamp field, set this value to the name of the field where you want `@timestamp` copied.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-url"]
===== `url`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value

The value of the API endpoint in the form of a URL.
