=== Cloudwatch output plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

This output lets you aggregate and send metric data to AWS CloudWatch

==== Summary:
This plugin is intended to be used on a logstash indexer agent (but that
is not the only way, see below.)  In the intended scenario, one cloudwatch
output plugin is configured, on the logstash indexer node, with just AWS API
credentials, and possibly a region and/or a namespace.  The output looks
for fields present in events, and when it finds them, it uses them to
calculate aggregate statistics.  If the `metricname` option is set in this
output, then any events which pass through it will be aggregated & sent to
CloudWatch, but that is not recommended.  The intended use is to NOT set the
metricname option here, and instead to add a `CW_metricname` field (and other
fields) to only the events you want sent to CloudWatch.

When events pass through this output they are queued for background
aggregation and sending, which happens every minute by default.  The
queue has a maximum size, and when it is full aggregated statistics will be
sent to CloudWatch ahead of schedule. Whenever this happens a warning
message is written to logstash's log.  If you see this you should increase
the `queue_size` configuration option to avoid the extra API calls.  The queue
is emptied every time we send data to CloudWatch.

Note: when logstash is stopped the queue is destroyed before it can be processed.
This is a known limitation of logstash and will hopefully be addressed in a
future version.

==== Details:
There are two ways to configure this plugin, and they can be used in
combination: event fields & per-output defaults

Event Field configuration...
You add fields to your events in inputs & filters and this output reads
those fields to aggregate events.  The names of the fields read are
configurable via the `field_*` options.

Per-output defaults...
You set universal defaults in this output plugin's configuration, and
if an event does not have a field for that option then the default is
used.

Notice, the event fields take precedence over the per-output defaults.

At a minimum events must have a "metric name" to be sent to CloudWatch.
This can be achieved either by providing a default here OR by adding a
`CW_metricname` field. By default, if no other configuration is provided
besides a metric name, then events will be counted (Unit: Count, Value: 1)
by their metric name (either a default or from their `CW_metricname` field)

Other fields which can be added to events to modify the behavior of this
plugin are, `CW_namespace`, `CW_unit`, `CW_value`, and
`CW_dimensions`.  All of these field names are configurable in
this output.  You can also set per-output defaults for any of them.
See below for details.

&nbsp;

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-access_key_id"]
===== `access_key_id` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

This plugin uses the AWS SDK and supports several ways to get credentials, which will be tried in this order:

1. Static configuration, using `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` params in logstash plugin config
2. External credentials file specified by `aws_credentials_file`
3. Environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
4. Environment variables `AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
5. IAM Instance Profile (available when running inside EC2)

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-aws_credentials_file"]
===== `aws_credentials_file` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Path to YAML file containing a hash of AWS credentials.
This file will only be loaded if `access_key_id` and
`secret_access_key` aren't set. The contents of the
file should look like this:

[source,ruby]
----------------------------------
    :access_key_id: "12345"
    :secret_access_key: "54321"
----------------------------------


[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-batch_size"]
===== `batch_size` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `20`

How many data points can be given in one call to the CloudWatch API

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-dimensions"]
===== `dimensions` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The default dimensions [ name, value, ... ] to use for events which do not have a `CW_dimensions` field

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-field_dimensions"]
===== `field_dimensions` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"CW_dimensions"`

The name of the field used to set the dimensions on an event metric
The field named here, if present in an event, must have an array of
one or more key & value pairs, for example...
    `add_field => [ "CW_dimensions", "Environment", "CW_dimensions", "prod" ]`
or, equivalently...
    `add_field => [ "CW_dimensions", "Environment" ]`
    `add_field => [ "CW_dimensions", "prod" ]`

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-field_metricname"]
===== `field_metricname` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"CW_metricname"`

The name of the field used to set the metric name on an event
The author of this plugin recommends adding this field to events in inputs &
filters rather than using the per-output default setting so that one output
plugin on your logstash indexer can serve all events (which of course had
fields set on your logstash shippers.)

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-field_namespace"]
===== `field_namespace` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"CW_namespace"`

The name of the field used to set a different namespace per event
Note: Only one namespace can be sent to CloudWatch per API call
so setting different namespaces will increase the number of API calls
and those cost money.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-field_unit"]
===== `field_unit` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"CW_unit"`

The name of the field used to set the unit on an event metric

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-field_value"]
===== `field_value` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"CW_value"`

The name of the field used to set the value (float) on an event metric

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-metricname"]
===== `metricname` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The default metric name to use for events which do not have a `CW_metricname` field.
Beware: If this is provided then all events which pass through this output will be aggregated and
sent to CloudWatch, so use this carefully.  Furthermore, when providing this option, you
will probably want to also restrict events from passing through this output using event
type, tag, and field matching

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-namespace"]
===== `namespace` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"Logstash"`

The default namespace to use for events which do not have a `CW_namespace` field

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-proxy_uri"]
===== `proxy_uri` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

URI to proxy server if required

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-queue_size"]
===== `queue_size` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `10000`

How many events to queue before forcing a call to the CloudWatch API ahead of `timeframe` schedule
Set this to the number of events-per-timeframe you will be sending to CloudWatch to avoid extra API calls

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-region"]
===== `region` 

  * Value can be any of: `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-central-1`, `eu-west-1`, `eu-west-2`, `ap-southeast-1`, `ap-southeast-2`, `ap-northeast-1`, `ap-northeast-2`, `sa-east-1`, `us-gov-west-1`, `cn-north-1`, `ap-south-1`, `ca-central-1`
  * Default value is `"us-east-1"`

The AWS Region

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-secret_access_key"]
===== `secret_access_key` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The AWS Secret Access Key

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-session_token"]
===== `session_token` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The AWS Session token for temporary credential

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-timeframe"]
===== `timeframe` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"1m"`

Constants
aggregate_key members
Units
How often to send data to CloudWatch
This does not affect the event timestamps, events will always have their
actual timestamp (to-the-minute) sent to CloudWatch.

We only call the API if there is data to send.

See the Rufus Scheduler docs for an https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler#the-time-strings-understood-by-rufus-scheduler[explanation of allowed values]

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-unit"]
===== `unit` 

  * Value can be any of: `Seconds`, `Microseconds`, `Milliseconds`, `Bytes`, `Kilobytes`, `Megabytes`, `Gigabytes`, `Terabytes`, `Bits`, `Kilobits`, `Megabits`, `Gigabits`, `Terabits`, `Percent`, `Count`, `Bytes/Second`, `Kilobytes/Second`, `Megabytes/Second`, `Gigabytes/Second`, `Terabytes/Second`, `Bits/Second`, `Kilobits/Second`, `Megabits/Second`, `Gigabits/Second`, `Terabits/Second`, `Count/Second`, `None`
  * Default value is `"Count"`

The default unit to use for events which do not have a `CW_unit` field
If you set this option you should probably set the "value" option along with it

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-value"]
===== `value` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"1"`

The default value to use for events which do not have a `CW_value` field
If provided, this must be a string which can be converted to a float, for example...
    "1", "2.34", ".5", and "0.67"
If you set this option you should probably set the `unit` option along with it
