=== App Search output plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

This output lets you send events to the Elastic App Search solution, 
both the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/app-search[self-managed] or 
the https://www.elastic.co/cloud/app-search-service[managed] service.
On receiving a batch of events from the Logstash pipeline, the plugin
converts the events into documents and uses the App Search bulk API
to index multiple events in one request.

App Search doesn't allow fields to begin with `@timestamp`.
By default the `@timestamp` and `@version` fields will be removed from
each event before the event is sent to App Search. If you want to keep
the `@timestamp` field, you can use the
<<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-timestamp_destination,timestamp_destination>> option
to store the timestamp in a different field.

NOTE: This gem does not support codec customization.
