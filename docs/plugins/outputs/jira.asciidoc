Uses jiralicious as the bridge to JIRA

By Martin Cleaver, Blended Perspectives
with a lot of help from 'electrical' in #logstash

This is most useful so you can use logstash to parse and structure
your logs and ship structured, json events to JIRA

To use this, you'll need to ensure your JIRA instance allows REST calls
