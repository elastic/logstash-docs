Summary: plugin to upload log events to Google BigQuery (BQ), rolling
files based on the date pattern provided as a configuration setting. Events
are written to files locally and, once file is closed, this plugin uploads
it to the configured BigQuery dataset.

VERY IMPORTANT:
. To make good use of BigQuery, your log events should be parsed and
structured. Consider using grok to parse your events into fields that can
be uploaded to BQ.
. You must configure your plugin so it gets events with the same structure,
so the BigQuery schema suits them. In case you want to upload log events
with different structures, you can utilize multiple configuration blocks,
separating different log events with Logstash conditionals. More details on
Logstash conditionals can be found here:
http://logstash.net/docs/1.2.1/configuration#conditionals

For more info on Google BigQuery, please go to:
https://developers.google.com/bigquery/

In order to use this plugin, a Google service account must be used. For
more information, please refer to:
https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#service_accounts

Recommendations:

. Experiment with the settings depending on how much log data you generate,
your needs to see "fresh" data, and how much data you could lose in the event
of crash. For instance, if you want to see recent data in BQ quickly, you
could configure the plugin to upload data every minute or so (provided you
have enough log events to justify that). Note also, that if uploads are too
frequent, there is no guarantee that they will be imported in the same order,
so later data may be available before earlier data.

. BigQuery charges for storage and for queries, depending on how much data
it reads to perform a query. These are other aspects to consider when
considering the date pattern which will be used to create new tables and also
how to compose the queries when using BQ. For more info on BigQuery Pricing,
please access:

USAGE:
This is an example of logstash config:

[source,json]
--------------------------
output {
   google_bigquery {
     project_id => "folkloric-guru-278"                        (required)
     dataset => "logs"                                         (required)
     csv_schema => "path:STRING,status:INTEGER,score:FLOAT"    (required) <1>
     key_path => "/path/to/privatekey.p12"                     (required)
     key_password => "notasecret"                              (optional)
     service_account => "1234@developer.gserviceaccount.com"   (required)
     temp_directory => "/tmp/logstash-bq"                      (optional)
     temp_file_prefix => "logstash_bq"                         (optional)
     date_pattern => "%Y-%m-%dT%H:00"                          (optional)
     flush_interval_secs => 2                                  (optional)
     uploader_interval_secs => 60                              (optional)
     deleter_interval_secs => 60                               (optional)
   }
}
--------------------------

<1> Specify either a csv_schema or a json_schema.

* Refactor common code between Google BQ and GCS plugins.
* Turn Google API code into a Plugin Mixin (like AwsConfig).
* There's no recover method, so if logstash/plugin crashes, files may not
be uploaded to BQ.

===== `csv_schema` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `nil`

Schema for log data. It must follow this format:
