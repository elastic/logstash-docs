=== drop

* Version: 3.0.2
* Released on: 2016-07-14
* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-drop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#302[Changelog]
* Compatible: 5.1.1.1, 5.0.0, 2.4.1, 2.4.0, 2.3.4



Drop filter.

Drops everything that gets to this filter.

This is best used in combination with conditionals, for example:

[source,ruby]
-----
    filter {
      if [loglevel] == "debug" {
        drop { }
      }
    }
-----

The above will only pass events to the drop filter if the loglevel field is
`debug`. This will cause all events matching to be dropped.

==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-filters-drop-add_field]]
===== `add_field` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * Default value is `{}`

If this filter is successful, add any arbitrary fields to this event.
Field names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`.

Example:
[source,ruby]
-----
    filter {
      drop {
        add_field => { "foo_%{somefield}" => "Hello world, from %{host}" }
      }
    }
-----

[source,ruby]
-----
    # You can also add multiple fields at once:
    filter {
      drop {
        add_field => {
          "foo_%{somefield}" => "Hello world, from %{host}"
          "new_field" => "new_static_value"
        }
      }
    }
-----

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would add field `foo_hello` if it is present, with the
value above and the `%{host}` piece replaced with that value from the
event. The second example would also add a hardcoded field.

[[plugins-filters-drop-add_tag]]
===== `add_tag` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, add arbitrary tags to the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`
syntax.

Example:
[source,ruby]
-----
    filter {
      drop {
        add_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
-----

[source,ruby]
-----
    # You can also add multiple tags at once:
    filter {
      drop {
        add_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "taggedy_tag"]
      }
    }
-----

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would add a tag `foo_hello` (and the second example would of course add a `taggedy_tag` tag).

[[plugins-filters-drop-enable_metric]]
===== `enable_metric` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `true`

Disable or enable metric logging for this specific plugin instance
by default we record all the metrics we can, but you can disable metrics collection
for a specific plugin.

[[plugins-filters-drop-id]]
===== `id` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Add a unique `ID` to the plugin instance, this `ID` is used for tracking
information for a specific configuration of the plugin.

```
output {
 stdout {
   id => "ABC"
 }
}
```

If you don't explicitely set this variable Logstash will generate a unique name.

[[plugins-filters-drop-percentage]]
===== `percentage` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `100`

Drop all the events within a pre-configured percentage.

This is useful if you just need a percentage but not the whole.

Example, to only drop around 40% of the events that have the field loglevel wiht value "debug".

[source,ruby]
-----
    filter {
      if [loglevel] == "debug" {
        drop {
          percentage => 40
        }
      }
    }
-----

[[plugins-filters-drop-periodic_flush]]
===== `periodic_flush` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `false`

Call the filter flush method at regular interval.
Optional.

[[plugins-filters-drop-remove_field]]
===== `remove_field` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary fields from this event.
Fields names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
Example:
[source,ruby]
-----
    filter {
      drop {
        remove_field => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
-----

[source,ruby]
-----
    # You can also remove multiple fields at once:
    filter {
      drop {
        remove_field => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "my_extraneous_field" ]
      }
    }
-----

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would remove the field with name `foo_hello` if it is present. The second
example would remove an additional, non-dynamic field.

[[plugins-filters-drop-remove_tag]]
===== `remove_tag` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary tags from the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`
syntax.

Example:
[source,ruby]
-----
    filter {
      drop {
        remove_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
-----

[source,ruby]
-----
    # You can also remove multiple tags at once:
    filter {
      drop {
        remove_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "sad_unwanted_tag"]
      }
    }
-----

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would remove the tag `foo_hello` if it is present. The second example
would remove a sad, unwanted tag as well.
