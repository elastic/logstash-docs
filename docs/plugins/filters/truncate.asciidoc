=== Truncate filter plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

Allows you to truncate fields longer than a given length.

This truncates on bytes values, not character count.  In practice, this
should mean that the truncated length is somewhere between `length_bytes` and
`length_bytes - 6` (UTF-8 supports up to 6-byte characters).

==== Truncate Filter Configuration Options

This plugin supports the following configuration options plus the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> described later.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-fields>> |<<string,string>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-length_bytes>> |<<number,number>>|Yes
|=======================================================================

Also see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for a list of options supported by all
filter plugins.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-fields"]
===== `fields` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

A list of fieldrefs to truncate if they are too long.

If not specified, the default behavior will be to attempt truncation on all
strings in the event. This default behavior could be computationally
expensive, so if you know exactly which fields you wish to truncate, it is
advised that you be specific and configure the fields you want truncated.

Special behaviors for non-string fields:

* Numbers: No action
* Array: this plugin will attempt truncation on all elements of that array.
* Hash: truncate will try all values of the hash (recursively, if this hash
contains other hashes).

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-length_bytes"]
===== `length_bytes` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Fields over this length will be truncated to this length.

Truncation happens from the end of the text (the start will be kept).

As an example, if you set `length_bytes => 10` and a field contains "hello
world, how are you?", then this field will be truncated and have this value:
"hello worl"
