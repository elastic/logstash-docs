=== Empow-classifier filter plugin

* This plugin was created and is maintained by a partner.
* {changelog_url}[Change log]
* {gem}[Gem] 

This is a plugin for https://github.com/elastic/logstash[Logstash].

It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you
are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.

==== Description

This plugin uses the cyber-kill-chain and MITRE representation language to
enrich security logs with information about the attackerâ€™s intent--what the
attacker is trying to achieve, who they are targeting, and how they plan to
carry out the attack. 

The plugin receives a set of security values extracted from the security log
(IDS signature IDs, Anti Virus hash value, or malware name, for example) as well
as the product type and brand. This information is sent by the plugin to the
Empow centralized classification service that automatically analyzes and gathers
relevant textual information and - using NLP based ML algorithms - classifies
the log into a specific intent. 

==== Documentation

Documentation for the 
https://github.com/empow/logstash-filter-empow-classifier/blob/master/README.md[filter-empow-classifier plugin] 
is maintained by the creators.
