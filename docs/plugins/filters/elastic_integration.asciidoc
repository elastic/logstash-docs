.Elastic Enterprise License
****
Use of this plugin requires an active Elastic Enterprise https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription].
****

==== Description

Use this filter to process Elastic integrations powered by {es} Ingest Node in {ls}.

.Extending Elastic integrations with {ls}
****
This plugin can help you take advantage of the extensive, built-in capabilities of {integrations-docs}[Elastic {integrations}]—​such as managing data collection,
transformation, and visualization—​and then use {ls} for additional data processing and output options.
For more info about extending Elastic integrations with {ls}, check out {logstash-ref}/ea-integrations.html[Using {ls} with Elastic Integrations].
****

When you configure this filter to point to an {es} cluster, it detects which ingest pipeline (if any) should be executed for each event,
using an explicitly-defined <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-pipeline_name>> or auto-detecting the event's data-stream and its default pipeline.

It then loads that pipeline's definition from {es} and run that pipeline inside Logstash without transmitting the event to {es}.
Events that are successfully handled by their ingest pipeline will have `[@metadata][target_ingest_pipeline]` set to `_none` so that any downstream {es} output in the Logstash pipeline will avoid running the event's default pipeline _again_ in {es}.

NOTE: Some multi-pipeline configurations such as logstash-to-logstash over http(s) do not maintain the state of `[@metadata]` fields.
      In these setups, you may need to explicitly configure your downstream pipeline's {es} output with `pipeline => "_none"` to avoid re-running the default pipeline.

Events that _fail_ ingest pipeline processing will be tagged with `_ingest_pipeline_failure`, and their `[@metadata][_ingest_pipeline_failure]` will be populated with details as a key/value map.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-requirements"]
===== Requirements and upgrade guidance

- This plugin requires Java 17 minimum with {ls} `8.x` versions and Java 21 minimum with {ls} `9.x` versions.
- When you upgrade the {stack}, upgrade {ls} (or this plugin specifically) _before_ you upgrade {kib}.
  (Note that this requirement is a departure from the typical {stack} https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/current/installing-elastic-stack.html#install-order-elastic-stack[installation order].) 
+
The {es}-{ls}-{kib} installation order recommended here ensures the best experience with {agent}-managed pipelines, and embeds functionality from a version of {es} Ingest Node that is compatible with the plugin version (`major`.`minor`).   

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-es-tips"]
===== Using `filter-elastic_integration` with `output-elasticsearch`

Elastic {integrations} are designed to work with {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-data-streams[data streams] and {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#_compatibility_with_the_elastic_common_schema_ecs[ECS-compatible] output.
Be sure that these features are enabled in the {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html[`output-elasticsearch`] plugin. 

* Set {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-data_stream[`data-stream`] to `true`. + 
  (Check out {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-data-streams[Data streams] for additional data streams settings.) 
* Set {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-ecs_compatibility[`ecs-compatibility`] to `v1` or `v8`.

Check out the {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html[`output-elasticsearch` plugin] docs for additional settings. 

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-minimum_configuration"]
==== Minimum configuration

You will need to configure this plugin to connect to {es}, and may need to also need to provide local GeoIp databases.

[source,ruby]
--------------------------------------------------
filter {
  elastic_integration {
    cloud_id   => "YOUR_CLOUD_ID_HERE"
    cloud_auth => "YOUR_CLOUD_AUTH_HERE"
    geoip_database_directory => "/etc/your/geoip-databases"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Read on for a guide to configuration, or jump to the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-options, complete list of configuration options>>.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-connecting_to_elasticsearch"]
==== Connecting to {es}

This plugin communicates with {es} to identify which ingest pipeline should be run for a given event, and to retrieve the ingest pipeline definitions themselves.
You must configure this plugin to point to {es} using exactly one of:

* A Cloud Id (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-cloud_id>>)
* A list of one or more host URLs (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-hosts>>)

Communication will be made securely over SSL unless you explicitly configure this plugin otherwise.

You may need to configure how this plugin establishes trust of the server that responds,
and will likely need to configure how this plugin presents its own identity or credentials.

===== SSL Trust Configuration

When communicating over SSL, this plugin fully-validates the proof-of-identity presented by {es} using the system trust store.
You can provide an _alternate_ source of trust with one of:

* A PEM-formatted list of trusted certificate authorities (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate_authorities>>)
* A JKS- or PKCS12-formatted Keystore containing trusted certificates (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path>>)

You can also configure which aspects of the proof-of-identity are verified (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode>>).

===== SSL Identity Configuration

When communicating over SSL, you can also configure this plugin to present a certificate-based proof-of-identity to the {es} cluster it connects to using one of:

* A PKCS8 Certificate/Key pair (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate>>)
* A JKS- or PKCS12-formatted Keystore (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_keystore_path>>)

===== Request Identity

You can configure this plugin to present authentication credentials to {es} in one of several ways:

* ApiKey: (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-api_key>>)
* Cloud Auth: (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-cloud_auth>>)
* HTTP Basic Auth: (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-username>> and <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-password>>)

NOTE: Your request credentials are only as secure as the connection they are being passed over.
      They provide neither privacy nor secrecy on their own, and can easily be recovered by an adversary when SSL is disabled.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-minimum_required_privileges"]
==== Minimum required privileges

This plugin communicates with Elasticsearch to resolve events into pipeline definitions and needs to be configured with credentials with appropriate privileges to read from the relevant APIs.
At the startup phase, this plugin confirms that current user has sufficient privileges, including:

[cols="<1,<1",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Privilege name | Description

| `monitor` | A read-only privilege for cluster operations such as cluster health or state. Plugin requires it when checks {es} license.
| `read_pipeline` | A read-only get and simulate access to ingest pipeline. It is required when plugin reads {es} ingest pipeline definitions.
| `manage_index_templates` | All operations on index templates privilege. It is required when plugin resolves default pipeline based on event data stream name.

|=======================================================================

[NOTE] 
--
This plugin cannot determine if an anonymous user has the required privileges when it connects to an {es} cluster that has security features disabled or when the user does not provide credentials.
The plugin starts in an unsafe mode with a runtime error indicating that API permissions are insufficient, and prevents events from being processed by the ingest pipeline.

To avoid these issues, set up user authentication and ensure that security in {es} is enabled (default). 
--
      
[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-supported_ingest_processors"]
==== Supported Ingest Processors

This filter can run {es} Ingest Node pipelines that are _wholly_ comprised of the supported subset of processors.
It has access to the Painless and Mustache scripting engines where applicable:

|=======================================================================


[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-field_mappings"]
===== Field Mappings

:esid: {es} Ingest Document

During execution the Ingest pipeline works with a temporary mutable _view_ of the Logstash event called an ingest document.
This view contains all of the as-structured fields from the event with minimal type conversions.

It also contains additional metadata fields as required by ingest pipeline processors:

* `_version`: a `long`-value integer equivalent to the event's `@version`, or a sensible default value of `1`.
* `_ingest.timestamp`: a `ZonedDateTime` equivalent to the event's `@timestamp` field

After execution completes the event is sanitized to ensure that Logstash-reserved fields have the expected shape, providing sensible defaults for any missing required fields.
When an ingest pipeline has set a reserved field to a value that cannot be coerced, the value is made available in an alternate location on the event as described below.

[cols="<1,<1,<5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| {ls} field | type | value

| `@timestamp` | `Timestamp` |
First coercible value of the ingest document's `@timestamp`, `event.created`, `_ingest.timestamp`, or `_now` fields; or the current timestamp.
When the ingest document has a value for `@timestamp` that cannot be coerced, it will be available in the event's `_@timestamp` field.

| `@version`   | String-encoded integer |
First coercible value of the ingest document's `@version`, or `_version` fields; or the current timestamp.
When the ingest document has a value for `@version` that cannot be coerced, it will be available in the event's `_@version` field.

| `@metadata`  | key/value map |
The ingest document's `@metadata`; or an empty map.
When the ingest document has a value for `@metadata` that cannot be coerced, it will be available in the event's `_@metadata` field.

| `tags`  | a String or a list of Strings |
The ingest document's `tags`.
When the ingest document has a value for `tags` that cannot be coerced, it will be available in the event's `_tags` field.
|=======================================================================

Additionally, these {es} IngestDocument Metadata fields are made available on the resulting event _if-and-only-if_ they were set during pipeline execution:

[cols="<1,<5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| {es} document metadata | {ls} field

| `_id`                | `[@metadata][_ingest_document][id]`
| `_index`             | `[@metadata][_ingest_document][index]`
| `_routing`           | `[@metadata][_ingest_document][routing]`
| `_version`           | `[@metadata][_ingest_document][version]`
| `_version_type`      | `[@metadata][_ingest_document][version_type]`
| `_ingest.timestamp`  | `[@metadata][_ingest_document][timestamp]`
|=======================================================================


[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-resolving"]
==== Resolving Pipeline Definitions

:cached-entry-ttl: 24 hours
:cache-reload-frequency: 1 minute

This plugin uses {es} to resolve pipeline names into their pipeline definitions.
When configured _without_ an explicit <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-pipeline_name>>, or when a pipeline uses the Reroute Processor, it also uses {es} to establish mappings of data stream names to their respective default pipeline names.

It uses hit/miss caches to avoid querying Elasticsearch for every single event.
It also works to update these cached mappings _before_ they expire.
The result is that when {es} is responsive this plugin is able to pick up changes quickly without impacting its own performance, and it can survive periods of {es} issues without interruption by continuing to use potentially-stale mappings or definitions.

To achieve this, mappings are cached for a maximum of {cached-entry-ttl}, and cached values are reloaded every {cache-reload-frequency} with the following effect:

* when a reloaded mapping is non-empty and is the _same_ as its already-cached value, its time-to-live is reset to ensure that subsequent events can continue using the confirmed-unchanged value
* when a reloaded mapping is non-empty and is _different_ from its previously-cached value, the entry is _updated_ so that subsequent events will use the new value
* when a reloaded mapping is newly _empty_, the previous non-empty mapping is _replaced_ with a new empty entry so that subsequent events will use the empty value
* when the reload of a mapping _fails_, this plugin emits a log warning but the existing cache entry is unchanged and gets closer to its expiry.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-options"]
==== {elastic-integration-name} Filter Configuration Options

This plugin supports the following configuration options plus the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> described later.

// Variables for re-use in per-option docs
:prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective: Cannot be combined with configurations that disable SSL
:prohibit-ssl-disabled-explicit: Cannot be combined with `<<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled>>=>false`.
:prohibit-ssl-verify-none: Cannot be combined with `<<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode>>=>none`.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-api_key"]
===== `api_key`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.

The encoded form of an API key that is used to authenticate this plugin to {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-cloud_auth"]
===== `cloud_auth`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.

Cloud authentication string ("<username>:<password>" format) is an alternative
for the `username`/`password` pair and can be obtained from Elastic Cloud web console.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-cloud_id"]
===== `cloud_id`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-explicit}

Cloud Id, from the Elastic Cloud web console.

When connecting with a Cloud Id, communication to {es} is secured with SSL.

For more details, check out the
{logstash-ref}/connecting-to-cloud.html[Logstash-to-Cloud documentation].

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-geoip_database_directory"]
===== `geoip_database_directory`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.

When running in a Logstash process that has Geoip Database Management enabled, integrations that use the Geoip Processor wil use managed Maxmind databases by default.
By using managed databases you accept and agree to the https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/eula[MaxMind EULA].

You may instead configure this plugin with the path to a local directory containing database files.

This plugin will discover all regular files with the `.mmdb` suffix in the provided directory, and make each available by its file name to the GeoIp processors in integration pipelines.
It expects the files it finds to be in the MaxMind DB format with one of the following database types:

* `AnonymousIp`
* `ASN`
* `City`
* `Country`
* `ConnectionType`
* `Domain`
* `Enterprise`
* `Isp`

[NOTE]
====
Most integrations rely on databases being present named _exactly_:

* `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb`,
* `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`, or
* `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`
====

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-hosts"]
===== `hosts`

* Value type is a list of <<uri,uri>>s
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Constraints:
** When any URL contains a protocol component, all URLs must have the same protocol as each other.
** `https`-protocol hosts use HTTPS and cannot be combined with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled, `ssl_enabled => false`>>.
** `http`-protocol hosts use unsecured HTTP and cannot be combined with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled, `ssl_enabled => true`>>.
** When any URL omits a port component, the default `9200` is used.
** When any URL contains a path component, all URLs must have the same path as each other.

A non-empty list of {es} hosts to connect.

Examples:

- `"127.0.0.1"`
- `["127.0.0.1:9200","127.0.0.2:9200"]`
- `["http://127.0.0.1"]`
- `["https://127.0.0.1:9200"]`
- `["https://127.0.0.1:9200/subpath"]` (If using a proxy on a subpath)

When connecting with a list of hosts, communication to {es} is secured with SSL unless configured otherwise.

[WARNING]
.Disabling SSL is dangerous
============
The security of this plugin relies on SSL to avoid leaking credentials and to avoid running illegitimate ingest pipeline definitions.

There are two ways to disable SSL:

* Provide a list of `http`-protocol hosts
* Set `<<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled>>=>false`

============

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-password"]
===== `password`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Required when request auth is configured with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-username>>

A password when using HTTP Basic Authentication to connect to {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-pipeline_name"]
===== `pipeline_name`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, the event's initial pipeline will _not_ be auto-detected from the event's data stream fields.
* Value may be a {logstash-ref}/event-dependent-configuration.html#sprintf[sprintf-style] template; if any referenced fields cannot be resolved the event will not be routed to an ingest pipeline.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate"]
===== `ssl_certificate`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key>> and <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key_passphrase>> are also required.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}

Path to a PEM-encoded certificate or certificate chain with which to identify this plugin to {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate_authorities"]
===== `ssl_certificate_authorities`

* Value type is a list of <<path,path>>s
* There is no default value for this setting.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}
* {prohibit-ssl-verify-none}

One or more PEM-formatted files defining certificate authorities.

This setting can be used to _override_ the system trust store for verifying the SSL certificate presented by {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled"]
===== `ssl_enabled`

* Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
* There is no default value for this setting.

Secure SSL communication to {es} is enabled unless:

* it is explicitly disabled with `ssl_enabled => false`; OR
* it is implicitly disabled by providing `http`-protocol <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-hosts>>.

Specifying `ssl_enabled => true` can be a helpful redundant safeguard to ensure this plugin cannot be configured to use non-ssl communication.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key"]
===== `ssl_key`

* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}

A password or passphrase of the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key>>.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path"]
===== `ssl_truststore_path`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_password>> is required.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}
* {prohibit-ssl-verify-none}

A path to JKS- or PKCS12-formatted keystore where trusted certificates are located.

This setting can be used to _override_ the system trust store for verifying the SSL certificate presented by {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_password"]
===== `ssl_truststore_password`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Required when connection trust is configured with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path>>

===== `ssl_verification_mode`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}

Level of verification of the certificate provided by {es}.

SSL certificates presented by {es} are fully-validated by default.

* Available modes:
** `none`: performs no validation, implicitly trusting any server that this plugin connects to (insecure)
** `certificate`: validates the server-provided certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority and that the server can prove possession of its associated private key (less secure)
** `full` (default): performs the same validations as `certificate` and also verifies that the provided certificate has an identity claim matching the server we are attempting to connect to (most secure)

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-username"]
===== `username`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-password>> is also required.

A user name when using HTTP Basic Authentication to connect to {es}.
