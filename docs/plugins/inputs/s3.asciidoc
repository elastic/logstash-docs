Files ending in `.gz` are handled as gzip'ed files.

==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-inputs-s3-access_key_id]]
===== `access_key_id` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

This plugin uses the AWS SDK and supports several ways to get credentials, which will be tried in this order:

1. Static configuration, using `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` params in logstash plugin config
2. External credentials file specified by `aws_credentials_file`
3. Environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
4. Environment variables `AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
5. IAM Instance Profile (available when running inside EC2)

[[plugins-inputs-s3-add_field]]
===== `add_field` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * Default value is `{}`

Add a field to an event

[[plugins-inputs-s3-aws_credentials_file]]
===== `aws_credentials_file` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Path to YAML file containing a hash of AWS credentials.
This file will only be loaded if `access_key_id` and
`secret_access_key` aren't set. The contents of the
file should look like this:

[source,ruby]
----------------------------------
 :access_key_id: "12345"
 :secret_access_key: "54321"
----------------------------------

[[plugins-inputs-s3-backup_add_prefix]]
===== `backup_add_prefix` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `nil`

Append a prefix to the key (full path including file name in s3) after processing.
If backing up to another (or the same) bucket, this effectively lets you
choose a new 'folder' to place the files in

[[plugins-inputs-s3-backup_to_bucket]]
===== `backup_to_bucket` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `nil`

The name of the S3 bucket.

[[plugins-inputs-s3-codec]]

[[plugins-inputs-s3-region_endpoint]]
===== `region_endpoint`  (DEPRECATED)

  * DEPRECATED WARNING: This configuration item is deprecated and may not be available in future versions.
  * Value can be any of: `us-east-1`, `us-west-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`, `ap-southeast-1`, `ap-southeast-2`, `ap-northeast-1`, `sa-east-1`, `us-gov-west-1`

Where to write the since database (keeps track of the date
the last handled file was added to S3). The default will write
sincedb files to some path matching "$HOME/.sincedb*"
Should be a path with filename not just a directory.

[[plugins-inputs-s3-tags]]
===== `tags` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

[[plugins-inputs-s3-type]]
===== `type` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Add a `type` field to all events handled by this input.

Types are used mainly for filter activation.

The type is stored as part of the event itself, so you can
also use the type to search for it in Kibana.

If you try to set a type on an event that already has one (for
example when you send an event from a shipper to an indexer) then
a new input will not override the existing type. A type set at
the shipper stays with that event for its life even
when sent to another Logstash server.

[[plugins-inputs-s3-use_ssl]]
===== `use_ssl` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `true`
