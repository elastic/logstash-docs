=== Heartbeat input plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

Generate heartbeat messages.

The general intention of this is to test the performance and
availability of Logstash.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs"]
==== Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

This plugin could provide a field, originally named `clock`, to track `epoch` or `sequence` incremental numbers. When
<<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility,ECS compatibility mode>> is enabled that value is now present in the
event's `[event][sequence]` subfield.

When <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility,ECS compatibility mode>> is enabled the use of `message` as
selector of sequence type is not available and only <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-sequence>> is considered. In this
case if `message` contains sequence selector strings it's ignored.

The existing `host` field is moved to `[host][name]` when ECS is enabled.

==== Heartbeat Input Configuration Options

This plugin supports the following configuration options plus the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> described later.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-count>> |<<number,number>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility>> | <<string,string>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-interval>> |<<number,number>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-message>> |<<string,string>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-sequence>> |<<string,string>> one of `["none", "epoch", "sequence"]`|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-threads>> |<<number,number>>|No
|=======================================================================

Also see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for a list of options supported by all
input plugins.

&nbsp;

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-count"]
===== `count`

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `-1`

How many times to iterate.
This is typically used only for testing purposes.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility"]
===== `ecs_compatibility`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Supported values are:
** `disabled`: `clock` counter field added at root level
** `v1`,`v8`: ECS compliant `[event][sequence]` counter field added to the event
* Default value depends on which version of Logstash is running:
** When Logstash provides a `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` setting, its value is used as the default
** Otherwise, the default value is `disabled`.

Controls this plugin's compatibility with the {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)].
Refer to <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs>> in this topic for detailed information.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-interval"]
===== `interval`

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `60`

Set how frequently messages should be sent.

The default, `60`, means send a message every 60 seconds.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-message"]
===== `message`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"ok"`

The message string to use in the event.

If you set this value to `epoch`, then this plugin will use the current
timestamp in unix timestamp (which is by definition, UTC).  It will
output this value into a field called `clock`

If you set this value to `sequence`, then this plugin will send a sequence of
numbers beginning at 0 and incrementing each interval.  It will
output this value into a field called `clock`

Otherwise, this value will be used verbatim as the event message. It
will output this value into a field called `message`

NOTE: Usage of `epoch`  and `sequence` in `message` setting is deprecated.
Consider using <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-sequence>> settings, which takes precedence
over the usage of `message` setting as selector.

NOTE: If <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility,ECS compatibility mode>> is enabled
and `message` contains `epoch` or `sequence`, it is ignored and is not present as a field in
the generated event.


[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-sequence"]
===== `sequence`

* Value can be any of: `none`, `epoch`, `sequence`
* Default value is `"none""`

If you set this value to `none`, then no sequence field is added.

If you set this value to `epoch`, then this plugin will use the current
timestamp in unix timestamp (which is by definition, UTC).  It will
output this value into a field called `clock` if <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility,ECS compatibility mode>>
is disabled. Otherwise, the field name is `[event][sequence]`.

If you set this value to `sequence`, then this plugin will send a sequence of
numbers beginning at 0 and incrementing each interval.  It will
output this value into a field called `clock` if <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility,ECS compatibility mode>>
is disabled. Otherwise, the field name is `[event][sequence]`

If `sequence` is defined, it takes precedence over `message` configuration.
If `message` doesn't have `epoch` or `sequence` values, it will be present in the generated event together with `clock`
field.


[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-threads"]
===== `threads`

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1`
