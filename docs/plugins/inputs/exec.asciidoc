=== Exec input plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

Periodically run a shell command and capture the whole output as an event.

[NOTE]
========
* The `command` field of this event will be the command run.
* The `message` field of this event will be the entire stdout of the command.
========

IMPORTANT: The exec input ultimately uses `fork` to spawn a child process.
Using fork duplicates the parent process address space (in our case, **logstash and the JVM**); this is mitigated with OS copy-on-write but ultimately you can end up allocating lots of memory just for a "simple" executable.
If the exec input fails with errors like `ENOMEM: Cannot allocate memory` it is an indication that there is not enough non-JVM-heap physical memory to perform the fork.


Example:

[source,ruby]
----------------------------------
input {
  exec {
    command => "echo 'hi!'"
    interval => 30
  }
}
----------------------------------

This will execute `echo` command every 30 seconds.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs"]
==== Compatibility with the Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

This plugin adds metadata about the event's source, and can be configured to do so
in an {ecs-ref}[ECS-compatible] way with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility>>.
This metadata is added after the event has been decoded by the appropriate codec,
and will not overwrite existing values.

| ECS Disabled               | ECS v1 , v8               | Description

| `host`                     | `[host][name]`            | The name of the {ls} host that processed the event
| `command`                  | `[process][command_line]` | The command run by the plugin
| `[@metadata][exit_status]` | `[process][exit_code]`    | The exit code of the process
| --                         | `[@metadata][input][exec][process][elapsed_time]`
                                                         | The elapsed time the command took to run in nanoseconds
| `[@metadata][duration]`    | --                        | Command duration in seconds as a floating point number (deprecated)

==== Exec Input configuration options

This plugin supports the following configuration options plus the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> described later.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-command>> |<<string,string>>|Yes
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility>> |<<string,string>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-interval>> |<<number,number>>|No
| <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-schedule>> |<<string,string>>|No
|=======================================================================

Also see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for a list of options supported by all
input plugins.

&nbsp;

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-command"]
===== `command` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Command to run. For example, `uptime`

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs_compatibility"]
===== `ecs_compatibility`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Supported values are:
    ** `disabled`: uses backwards compatible field names, such as `[host]`
    ** `v1`, `v8`: uses fields that are compatible with ECS, such as `[host][name]`

Controls this plugin's compatibility with the {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)].
See <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ecs>> for detailed information.


**Sample output: ECS enabled**
[source,ruby]
-----
{
    "message" => "hi!\n",
    "process" => {
        "command_line" => "echo 'hi!'",
        "exit_code" => 0
    },
    "host" => {
        "name" => "deus-ex-machina"
    },

    "@metadata" => {
        "input" => {
            "exec" => {
                "process" => {
                    "elapsed_time"=>3042
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
-----

**Sample output: ECS disabled**
[source,ruby]
-----
{
    "message" => "hi!\n",
    "command" => "echo 'hi!'",
    "host" => "deus-ex-machina",

    "@metadata" => {
        "exit_status" => 0,
        "duration" => 0.004388
    }
}
-----

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-interval"]
===== `interval` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Interval to run the command. Value is in seconds.

Either `interval` or `schedule` option must be defined.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-schedule"]
===== `schedule` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Schedule of when to periodically run command.

This scheduling syntax is powered by https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler[rufus-scheduler].
The syntax is cron-like with some extensions specific to Rufus (e.g. timezone support).

Examples:

|==========================================================
| `* 5 * 1-3 *`               | will execute every minute of 5am every day of January through March.
| `0 * * * *`                 | will execute on the 0th minute of every hour every day.
| `0 6 * * * America/Chicago` | will execute at 6:00am (UTC/GMT -5) every day.
|==========================================================

Further documentation describing this syntax can be found https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler#parsing-cronlines-and-time-strings[here].

Either `interval` or `schedule` option must be defined.
