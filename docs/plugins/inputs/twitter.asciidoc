keyword string.
See https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/request-parameters#track 
for more details.

The wildcard "*" option is not supported. To ingest a sample stream of 
all tweets, the use_samples option is recommended. 

[[plugins-inputs-twitter-languages]]
===== `languages` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

A list of BCP 47 language identifiers corresponding to any of the languages listed
on Twitter’s advanced search page will only return tweets that have been detected 
as being written in the specified languages.

[[plugins-inputs-twitter-locations]]
===== `locations` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

A comma-separated list of longitude, latitude pairs specifying a set
of bounding boxes to filter tweets by.

[[plugins-inputs-twitter-oauth_token]]

Your oauth token.

To get this, login to Twitter with whatever account you want,
then visit <https://dev.twitter.com/apps>

Click on your app (used with the consumer_key and consumer_secret settings)
Then at the bottom of the page, click 'Create my access token' which
will create an oauth token and secret bound to your account and that
application.

[[plugins-inputs-twitter-oauth_token_secret]]
===== `oauth_token_secret` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<password,password>>

To get this, login to Twitter with whatever account you want,
then visit <https://dev.twitter.com/apps>

Click on your app (used with the consumer_key and consumer_secret settings)
Then at the bottom of the page, click 'Create my access token' which
will create an oauth token and secret bound to your account and that
application.

[[plugins-inputs-twitter-tags]]
===== `tags` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Add any number of arbitrary tags to your event.

This can help with processing later.

[[plugins-inputs-twitter-type]]
===== `type` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Add a `type` field to all events handled by this input.

Types are used mainly for filter activation.

The type is stored as part of the event itself, so you can
also use the type to search for it in Kibana.

If you try to set a type on an event that already has one (for
example when you send an event from a shipper to an indexer) then
a new input will not override the existing type. A type set at
the shipper stays with that event for its life even
when sent to another Logstash server.

[[plugins-inputs-twitter-use_samples]]
===== `use_samples` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `false`

Returns a small random sample of all public statuses. The tweets returned
by the default access level are the same, so if two different clients connect
to this endpoint, they will see the same tweets. If set to true, the keywords, 
follows, locations, and languages options will be ignored. Default => false
