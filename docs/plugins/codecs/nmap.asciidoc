=== Nmap codec plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

This codec is used to parse https://nmap.org/[namp] output data which is serialized in XML format. Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. 
For more information on nmap, see https://nmap.org/.

This codec can only be used for decoding data.

Event types are listed below

`nmap_scan_metadata`: An object containing top level information about the scan, including how many hosts were up, and how many were down. Useful for the case where you need to check if a DNS based hostname does not resolve, where both those numbers will be zero.
`nmap_host`: One event is created per host. The full data covering an individual host, including open ports and traceroute information as a nested structure.
`nmap_port`: One event is created per host/port. This duplicates data already in `nmap_host`: This was put in for the case where you want to model ports as separate documents in Elasticsearch (which Kibana prefers).
`nmap_traceroute_link`: One of these is output per traceroute 'connection', with a `from` and a `to` object describing each hop. Note that traceroute hop data is not always correct due to the fact that each tracing ICMP packet may take a different route. Also very useful for Kibana visualizations.
